# Introduction

In this article we are going to make a very interesting home-automation project.

We have made lots of home-automation project with BLYNK IOT cloud platform, those projects were great.

Now BLYNK comes with an update that is BLYNK2.0, blynk2.0 has lots of amazing features that we miss in our previous projects.

One of the feature in blynk2.0 is OTA , that is we can now update the code or WIFI credentials over the air, now we don't need to hard-code the credentials or code every time we want to change , this feature is very useful.

I will make a home-automation project using blynk2.0 and my 4 Node SMT Home-automation PCB.

In this home-automation project we can control our home appliances via BLYNK smartphone application from anywhere in this world. and also we can control our home-appliances via manual switch buttons and also we can monitor the real time status in the BLYNK app.

This home-automation PCB is very small in size and compact which can easily fits in your electrical switch boards.

This PCB is compatible for all the smart speakers available in the market like Amazons Alexa , google home and Apples SIRI.
